# self-guided_cs229
I am independently completing the Stanford "CS229:Machine Learning" course. In this repo, I post my completed assignments for the course. I am completing this course to strengthen my foundation in a wide array of machine learning topics, and specifically focusing on the mathematical underpinnings of statistical learning. There are three problem sets and a final project for this iteration of the course. 

# Reproducibility
- Donwnload Anaconda Distribution and run `conda env create -f environment.yml` to create the corresponding conda environment.

# Checkpoints
- 2/6/24: Completed and uploaded Problem Set 1
- 3/11/24: Completed and uploaded Problem Set 2
- 3/31/24: Completed and uploaded Problem Set 3 (Final Problem Set)
